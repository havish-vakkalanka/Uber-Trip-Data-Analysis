# Uber Trip Data Analysis

## Introduction

This project delves into the analysis of Uber trip data to uncover urban travel patterns and enhance transportation policies and strategies. Leveraging extensive data from Uber, we aim to provide a unique perspective on urban mobility, crucial for understanding modern transportation trends and improving the efficiency of ride-sharing services.

## Project Objective and Goals

- **Analyze Urban Travel Patterns:** Utilize Uber's comprehensive trip data to identify trends and behaviors in urban travel.
- **Enhance Ride-Sharing Efficiency:** Propose improvements for ride-sharing services focusing on efficiency and customer satisfaction based on insights from the data.
- **Predictive Trend Analysis:** Employ predictive models to forecast future transportation trends and rider preferences.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Offer actionable recommendations for urban transportation planning and policy-making.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to develop a time series and financial analysis using Apache Spark in Databricks, focusing on accurate projections for the years 2021 and 2022. Challenges include handling large volumes of data in Parquet file format and producing interactive dashboards and visualizations for time and financial analysis. The system aims to be scalable, efficient, and user-friendly.

## Dataset Description

Data for this analysis was obtained from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission in Parquet file format for the years 2021 and 2022, comprising up to 23 million records. The dataset provides a detailed schema including trip times, distances, fares, and locations (pickup and dropoff points).

## Methodology

Using Databricks and Apache Spark, we processed and analyzed the data to understand Uber's operational patterns. The workflow included data cleaning, processing, and visualization to derive insights from the data effectively.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Databricks:** Used for data processing and analysis.
- **Apache Spark:** Employed for handling large-scale data processing.
- **Data Visualization:** Insights are presented through dynamic and interactive dashboards.

## Key Findings

- **Trip Time Analysis:** Identified peak periods for Uber services, aiding in understanding daily transportation flows.
- **Revenue Analysis:** Examined total and net revenue to understand the financial aspects of Uber services.
- **Service Efficiency:** Evaluated rider wait times and identified high-demand pickup locations for strategic planning.

## Future Considerations

Future work includes scaling the analysis tools and infrastructure with growing data volumes, developing real-time data analysis capabilities, and ensuring data privacy and security.
